Here are other **important control flows** in your e-commerce platform that are similar in complexity and importance to the user purchase flow. For each, Iâ€™ll describe the flow, the main endpoints involved, and what you might want to test with curl or in the frontend.

- Stock should be restored if the order is cancelled.

**Test:**
- Place an order, then cancel it, then check product stock and order status.

### **Would you like to test any of these flows with curl?**
- For example, I can demonstrate **order cancellation** (with stock restoration), **coupon application**, or **review submission**.
- Let me know which flow you want to see tested, or if you want a script for all of them!
